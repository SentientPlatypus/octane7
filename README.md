 Im making a rocket league car, that can actually jump, track the ball, and hopefully do aerials. Watch me

 The boost system is created with an EDF, completely made in-house. I modeled the fan in fusion 360, and 3-d printed it.



 THe jumping system is actuated by 2 spring-loaded mechanisms, attached to each axle.
